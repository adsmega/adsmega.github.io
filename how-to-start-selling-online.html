										<h2>4 Steps to Start Selling Online Until Successfully Getting Buyers</h2>
										<div class="image-full"><img src="assets/img/online-business.jpeg" alt="Start Online Bussiness"></div>
										<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;"><br>Imagining online sales is interesting but also scary. On the one hand, we see there are millions of internet users in the world, there is a big market here.<br><br>
										But on the other hand, it seems the way to start is complicated.<br><br>
										Even if there is a step by step that can be followed like folding origami, surely there are many offline sellers who come online.<br><br>
										Here is the guide.<br><br>
										After reading this article, you will know what you can do right now to start selling online.<br><br>
										Selling online now is very easy since there is a marketplace (online market). Such as Amazon, eBay, etc.<br><br>
										5 minutes from now, you can start selling and getting buyers. it's easy, right?<br><br>
										Even some sellers only rely on the marketplace or social media to sell, without creating their website.<br><br>
										Yes, You can... But there is a big weakness behind it.<br><br>
										First, the places of selling are not your own. Supposing you are riding in sales at other people's homes. As a result, your sales can be closed at any time.<br><br>
										Besides, you also look no different from other sellers. This is not good for the long term, because you will not be known.<br><br>
										Second, it is difficult to grow.<br><br>
										I often see people who 100% rely on social media to sell. The business is stable ... it doesn't run out of buyers, but there is no progress.<br><br>
										What is the solution? Use both.<br><br>
										Growing your website takes time, you can use the marketplace and social media to introduce them to your website.<br><br>
										<b>Step # 0 - Don't know what you want to sell?</b><br><br>
										This is the biggest problem for people who want to do business.<br>
										<i>(If you already know what to sell, proceed to step # 1)</i><br><br>
										The best choice for those who are willing to make a little more effort is making their products. Digital products are not difficult to make as long as you already know what capabilities you can make into products. Or you can also sell services. Other options become a reseller or drop shipper.<br><br>
										You have to solve this problem yourself ... because you know what you want to sell for long-term business.<br><br>
										<b>Step # 1 - Build a sales website foundation</b><br><br>
										As mentioned earlier, selling at someone else's "home" is not enough. In the short term, it might work ... but not in the long term.<br><br>
										You have to have your website. Need fees ... for hosting and domains. But these costs are nothing compared to the income you will get from sales.<br><br>
										If you start without funds, 0 dollars, no need to directly create a website. Sell your first product/service and then use the money to build a website.<br><br>
										Talk about selling online, usually related to online stores or e-commerce.<br><br>
										Though maybe you don't need an online store.<br><br>
										Most people usually only sell 1-5 products online. If you are also like this, do not create an online store that has a variety of features.<br><br>
										The solution: make 1 page for 1 type of item.<br><br>
										So you make one sales page each for each product. This page contains the title, picture/video, explanation, and how to buy.<br><br>
										But if you have dozens of products, an e-commerce system will be easier.<br><br>
										<b>1a. Without an online shop system</b><br><br>
										Once again, if you only sell 1-5 types of products/services. Pages like this are enough:<br><br>
										<img src="assets/img/1a.jpg"><br>
										Even though you have never created a website before, creating a page like the one above only takes less than 10 minutes. Lots of guides on the internet.<br><br>
										<b>Step # 2 - Build the foundation of social media</b><br><br>
										As a seller, of course, we have to invite buyers to come ... for that we will go to a place with many people, social media.<br><br>
										But remember..<br><br>
										Social media is a marketing and communication tool with customers, NOT as your main selling place.<br><br>
										Invite them to your website to buy.<br><br>
										Also, keep in mind that not all products/services can be successfully marketed with social media. Look again at your target market.<br><br>
										Some social media that are commonly used as a means marketing :<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Facebook</li>
												<li>Instagram</li>
												<li>Pinterest</li>
											</ul>
										It doesn't have to be all... Even less is better because you can be more focused.<br><br>
										So make sure, where your target market is most active. Then you will also be active on the same social media.<br><br>
										<b>2a. Facebook</b><br><br>
										This social media seems easy, but actually, it is the most difficult.<br><br>
										Therefore do not be careless. Facebook has a strict spam filter, and you will not be notified if you have been labeled a spammer.<br><br>
										So many people are wasting time on Facebook. This page has more than 27 thousand likes:<br><br>
										<img src="assets/img/2a.jpg"><br><br>
										But all the posts like this ... no one commented / like / share.<br><br>
										How did it happen?<br><br>
										There are 3 possible causes:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Buy LIKE from other people or with FB ads</li>
												<li>There are no interesting posts</li>
												<li>Posting too often (optimally 2x a day)</li>
											</ul>
										Never buy like! although using the official Facebook Ads.<br><br>
										If you have a lot of followers, but no one has ever interacted with all your posts, then all of your posts will never appear in someone else's News Feed.<br><br>
										Try each of your posts to get lots of likes/shares/comments.<br><br>
										Here's what you can post:<br>
										<ul>
											<li>Trends or news in industries related to your business</li>
											<li>Attractive photos with good quality</li>
											<li>An inspiring story or a pearl of wisdom</li>
											<li>Product photos - but it must be interesting</li>
										</ul>
										Like this one:<br><br>
										<img src="assets/img/2a2.jpg"><br><br>
										<b>2b. Instagram</b><br><br>
										Here's why Instagram is so popular for businesses:<br>
										<blockquote>On Facebook, the engagement rate per post is only around 0.05-1%, while on Instagram it reaches 4.21%. Meaning your photos will get more interactions (in the form of comments/likes). That's why there are lots of active businesses on Instagram.</blockquote>
										Tips every time you send photos to Instagram:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Photos must be beautiful (if you can't provide good photos, it's better not to use Instagram)</li>
												<li>Use 5-10 #hashtags that are relevant</li>
												<li>The optimum number of posts 1-2 times a day (can be more if your photos are interesting)</li>
												<li>For product photos include a description, price, and how to buy</li>
												<li>Don't spam other people's unrelated photos</li>
											</ul>
										<b>Step # 3 - Get the first sale</b><br><br>
										Creating a website and social media foundation is easy, the real challenge is getting your first buyer. Not being able to sell means your business will fail.<br><br>
										There are several critical success factors in sales. For example, the price is competitive, the quality is good, the service is friendly.<br><br>
										Let's assume you are the best at these 3 things.<br><br>
										Not guaranteed you can get buyers ... Why?<br><br>
										Because 90% of the market is the same as you. The price of the A and the B is not much different, the quality is equally superior. If so, those three things are no longer relevant ... right?<br><br>
										Low prices, high quality, friendly service ... this is not enough.<br><br>
										So what's more important is how you can appear in front of them, and convince them to buy from you.<br><br>
										In this step, we will discuss how to get buyers for those of you who are just starting to sell online.<br><br>
										One more thing, don't (only) rely on SEO.<br><br>
										You need months to reach the first page. Plus if you only rely on SEO, chances are that you will never succeed. The results of the SEO later will come by itself.<br><br>
										For now, do these steps:<br><br>
										<b>3a. Join the online market</b><br><br>
										Although I said earlier that you should not take advantage of the marketplace for the long term, in practice it is very effective in getting buyers.<br><br>
										Especially when it's your first time selling. This is because on these websites there are already many people who are ready to buy.<br><br>
										There are 2 conditions in which the marketplace is effective:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li>Its products are commonly sought after (for example iPhone charger)</li>
												<li>You don't know how to get visitors</li>
											</ul>
										Developing your website takes time. New websites cannot be immediately recognized by many people.<br><br>
										Therefore, selling in the marketplace can be the solution while introducing your business and your website. But, remember ... don't 100% rely on the marketplace.<br><br>
										<b>3b. Create content and distribute</b><br><br>
										There is no doubt that social media and community sites are the best places to bring visitors quickly. But many people fail because the promotion method is wrong.<br><br>
										The problem is that they directly promote links to the homepage or sales page to the community site.<br><br>
										There are 3 types of people on the internet:<br>
											<ol>
												<li>Searching for information</li>
												<li>Looking for entertainment</li>
												<li>Buy products/services</li>
											</ol>
										And on community sites, there are only the first and second types. This means that if you put a link about the sale, you will be kicked out, or labeled as a spammer.<br><br>
										But even so, it doesn't mean you can't promote on a community site ... you can, the way you have to change.<br><br>
										Like this:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Find a community site that suits your business</li>
												<li>Look for the main problems of the people there</li>
												<li>Create content that can be a solution to the problem<li>
												<li>Distribute</li>
											</ul>
										Because most people on the internet want to get information, these strategies are very effective for introducing your business and getting buyers.<br><br>
										Your website will also be easily found through search engines.<br><br>
										<b>3c. Start experiment with Facebook Ads dan Google AdWords</b><br><br>
										If you have a marketing budget, use one or both.<br><br>
										Compared to other marketing methods, advertising can bring many visitors at once in a short amount of time. But because it costs money, you have to experiment to get the best results at the lowest cost.<br><br>
										The biggest question is Choose Facebook or Google AdWords?<br><br>
										There is no definitive answer. It all depends on what you sell, and to whom you sell ... as well as personal taste.<br><br>
										Here is something you can consider:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>If the keywords you want are searched through Google, use AdWords. If not, use Facebook.</li>
												<li>Interest and demographics on Facebook are more accurate.</li>
												<li>For sales conversions, AdWords is superior (but generally the price per click is more expensive)</li>
												<li>For non-sales conversions, Facebook is superior.</li>
											</ul>
										<img src="assets/img/3c.jpg"><br><br>
										Advertising online is experimenting, you will only know which is the best after trying.<br><br>
										<b>3d Get endorsements from popular person on Instagram</b><br><br>
										Although I have never tried this one, it seems like many people who claim to get positive results after being endorsed by Instagram celebrities.<br><br>
										How it works:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Look for Instagram accounts that have many followers and are the right target market</li>
												<li>Send them your products for free</li>
												<li>They will recommend your product to their followers through photos</li>
											</ul>
										So without additional costs other than sending the product.<br><br>
										<img src="assets/img/3d.jpg"><br>
										<i>(This is the simplest form, just a mention.)</i><br><br>
										There are further tips:<br>
										If you want to get lots of followers, you can also make a small contest.<br><br>
										Ask the instagram celebrities to tell his followers that you are holding a contest to get a product that is endorsed.<br><br>
										For example, you have cosmetic products.<br><br>
										To be able to get your product for free, they must follow you. Then you choose the winner from the list of followers.<br><br>
										It could also be added to have them upload their make-up photo collection. That way, they have a reason to follow your account.<br><br>
										But remember, before starting your account you must have interesting photos.<br><br>
										<b>3e. Get endorsements from bloggers</b><br><br>
										Just like the steps above, the difference is from the blogger. So no need to explain at length again.<br><br>
										How to find the blogger:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Through Google: use keywords - blogger + "topic"</li>
												<li>Blogger community: like Female Blogger</li>
												<li>Blogger group on Facebook</li>
											</ul>
										To note in choosing a blogger:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li>Quality of the content</li>
												<li>The website design</li>
												<li>The traffic</li>
												<li>Comments of the readers</li>
											</ul>
										<b>3f. Perform AMA (Ask Me Anything) in community forums</b><br><br>
										Just like social media, online forums are also a very effective place to get buyers. But (again) you will be expelled if only promote your products.<br><br>
										To be able to promote business, you must at least provide benefits to its members. This can be by creating interesting threads/discussions or answering other people's threads. Or by combining the two.<br><br>
										<b><i>make AMA.</i></b><br><br>
										I borrowed this term from the Reddit community site. This means you invite people to ask you questions (of course related to a topic).<br><br>
										Here's an example on Reddit:<br>
										<img src="assets/img/3f.png"><br><br>
										This person created a thread that invited other members to ask anything about game-research / analytics ... and 50 peoples were asking.<br><br>
										Note that he also announced that he is launching a new product.<br><br>
										Both parties both benefit.<br><br>
										The product is known by many people ... while other people can ask questions about things that are interesting to them.<br><br>
										The topic of the AMA must be appropriate for your business ... in that case, the product was related to game-research / analytics.<br><br>
										Because as a seller you (should) understand very well with the industry, then question and answer like this is not a big problem.<br><br>
										<b>Step # 4 - Than just selling into a business</b><br><br>
										Successful selling does not mean a successful business. Successfully selling to just a hundred people doesn't mean you already have a business.<br><br>
										There is a big difference.<br><br>
										If you only sell, it is very likely that in the next few years or months your income stream will stop. While our target is to build a long-term business. Even until you retire.<br><br>
										So what's the difference between selling and doing business?<br><br>
										Here's the difference:<br><br>
										<img src="assets/img/4.png"><br><br>
										The picture above is usually called the marketing funnel, or a customer's journey from unknown to deciding to buy.<br><br>
										The explanation is as follows:<br>
										<ol>
											<li>Awareness: aware of your existence</li>
											<li>Interest: interested and want to learn more</li>
											<li>Consideration: decide to try</li>
											<li>Purchase: buy</li>
											<li>Retention: keep using your service, loyal</li>
											<li>Advocacy: recommend you to others</li>
										</ol>
										If you only sell, it means the process stops at number 4 - purchase.<br><br>
										If a salesperson does not think about the next stage of retention and advocacy which is the main thing in business continuity ... customer satisfaction.<br><br>
										As a result, Sales did not increase, and business dies over the time.<br><br>
										Because quality (and price) has become a basic spec ... people will not buy if they do not meet both. So everything on the market must have competed.<br><br>
										So the determinant of satisfaction is not just that.<br><br>
										Therefore you should look at the marketing funnel as a whole from 1-6, not just focus on the sell, sell, and sell.<br><br>
										<b>4a Do content marketing</b><br><br>
										Content marketing holds the biggest role in the marketing funnel cycle.<br><br>
										For example, as explained earlier, so that other people know you then you should provide useful content.<br><br>
										... that's the awareness stage.<br><br>
										What about advertising? Isn't advertising more effective at bringing in lots of visitors?<br><br>
										It is true.<br><br>
										But not all businesses can rely on advertising to directly get sales. It's more effective if we get them interested first ... while building trust.<br><br>
										That is, even in advertisements you need content.<br><br>
										To build awareness, the best types of content are those that educate and provide benefits.<br><br>
										<b>4b. Do list building and email marketing</b><br><br>
										List building means the process of collecting emails from potential customers. While email marketing is a marketing process with email as the medium.<br><br>
										What is great about email?<br><br>
										66% of customers decide to buy the results of email marketing. The above statistics are quoted from the Direct Marketing Association, 2013.<br><br>
										This is because e-mail is always part of our habits. Even because email is already integrated with smartphones, email can (and will) be more effective than SMS.<br><br>
										So email feels more personal than the content found on blogs for example.<br><br>
										The flow is like this:<br>
											<ol>
												<li>Visitors come to the website because of content marketing efforts</li>
												<li>Interested in the content, then they registered the email</li>
												<li>You send useful content via email</li>
												<li>Finally, make sales via email</li>
											</ol>
										When viewed in the marketing funnel earlier, email marketing is the right method to optimize your marketing efforts in the consideration section.<br><br>
										So by combining content marketing and email marketing, a positive relationship with buyers will also remain established.<br><br>
										So that your business has now touched the six points in the marketing funnel.<br><br>
										Your business becomes a cycle that does not end. You now have a system to bring in visitors and sell automatically.<br><br>
										That's all the stages you need to know to start selling. Not difficult right?<br><br>
										All of the above steps do not require any skill to get started, you can learn while walking.<br><br>
										But I'm sure there are still those who will think this is difficult... <i>(maybe because it's been a long time)</i><br><br>
										Therefore, to find out whether this is difficult or not ... prove it yourself by trying.
